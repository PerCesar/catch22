Catch-22
This is the case study project for TEKSystems 

Case Study Premise
Catch22 is based on this concept that “a problem for which the only solution is denied by a circumstance inherent in the problem or by a rule.” Catch22 is a competition whereby participants must pay money (for borrowing equipment and fees) in order to make money (win the big prize!). The game at play here is bird watching in Brooklyn. There will be a specific list of 40 birds considered to be migratory species (meaning they do not live in Brooklyn all year long) as they travel northbound or southbound depending on the season. Each participant will be lent equipment such as DSLR cameras with zoom lenses (along optional binoculars) to go and chase these little beasts! The pictures will be verified by park organizers to validate the species reported by participant. Whoever captures a total of 22 birds from that exclusive list will earn big bucks! The goal is to enroll as many as 100 participants to get enough funds to donate to park conservation efforts to improve the natural of environment of these animals!

Participant will be able to
-	Enroll using a website provided by Cesar’s birding club: localhost:8080
-	Submit payment for borrowing basic equipment needed to take amazing pictures of birds and have fun at it
-	Keep track of the competition to see who has captured the most birds! 
-	Access park organizers’ information about facts about the park and when during the week there will be group walks in the park to watch birds
-	See when the expected due date to return borrowed items is
-	See participating parks
-	See the list of birds at a glance 
-	Keep track of number of species captured!

Challenges
The main challenge I faced is the integration of all these technologies into a single project hosted in spring suite tool. At times, I had to study my own project to figure out relationships and to make it simpler.
Also, many times I had to painstakingly review line by line the error messages after hitting run code as a spring boot application. I spent many hours trying to find solutions that more often than not was a simple punctuation error or misspelled word. 
The implementation of spring boot securities was tough initially as it blocked my localhost:8080 port from seeing the result of my code. I took those respective annotations off in order to gain access to that port. 
Overall, I have learned that troubleshooting is part of the field of programming. There is always a new problem to solve and new challenges. One must learn to accept this truth to enjoy this career.
